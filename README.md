## Light
WIP lightweight chat client

This is intended to be a quick and easily pluggable chat client for various devices, mobile or desktop. This project seeks to address multi-protocol chat clients dropping in popularity in favor of web-based clients or specific apps that only communicate with one service.

I currently use the chat client [pidgin](https://pidgin.im) (or [adium](https://adium.im)), but I wanted to try my own take on creating a similar program
